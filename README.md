# WarriorsNFT :crossed_swords:
WarriorsNFT is a decentralized application that lets users mint unique warrior NFTs with randomized attributes and merge two NFTs to mint a higher rarity NFT. 
This project demonstrates NFT minting using the ERC721 standard and features a gacha-style minting system with merging capabilities. 

The project is built using React, Solidity, and Hardhat for smart contract development and testing. Bootstrap 5/Reactstrap is used for styling the front-end, creating a responsive user interface. The application interacts with Ethereum smart contracts to handle NFT minting and merging, while React manages the user experience.
